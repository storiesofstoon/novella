# Scene Name Here
As the howling wind battered the convent walls, Sister Elsbeth awoke with a start, the sound of the cruel wind's howl reverberating in her ears like an omen. She sat up in her bed, shivering as the frost-covered windows cast a pale glow over her cell, the chill seeping through the thick stone walls. The air was thick with the scent of incense and old wood, but even it couldn't mask the biting cold that had settled in the halls. She rubbed her hands together, trying to generate some heat as she made her way to the common area where the other sisters had gathered. Shivering and huddled together like a flock of frightened birds, they huddled around the fireplace, their breath visible in the frigid air. Sister Agnes stood out among them, her fiery red hair seeming to burn bright in the dim light as she cast a challenging glance around the room. The flames danced in the grate, casting flickering shadows on their pale faces, and the crackling wood provided the only hint of warmth in the icy chamber.

Sister Elsbeth took her place beside Sister Asterid, who wrapped an arm around her shoulders, offering what little comfort she could muster amidst their shared discomfort. They all knew that winter was harsh in these parts, but this year felt different - more oppressive, more unyielding. The cold seemed to have seeped into the very bones of the building, as if it were determined to freeze  them all where they stood. Even the steam from their cups of tea couldn't quite dispel the chill that clung to them like a second skin.

Outside, the wind howled like a pack of hungry wolves, echoing through the empty corridors and down into the chapel below. It was as if the very earth itself had turned against them, as if they were trespassers on a hostile land. The snowstorm raged on, relentless in its fury, and Sister Elsbeth couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a normal winter's blizzard. There was something malevolent about it, something that sent shivers down her spine. She glanced around at her sisters, each one trying to ignore the discomfort but failing miserably. Sister Agnes was the only one who met her gaze, a spark of rebellion lighting up her eyes.

"The storm will not break soon," whispered Sister Ingred, her voice barely above a whisper. Her dark hair hung limply around her face, betraying her own unease. Sister Margaret Walsh nodded in agreement from her perch by the bookshelf, her mousy bun quivering slightly as she clutched a worn tome to her chest. "It's strange, isn't it?" she murmured, her voice barely above the roar of the wind outside. "As if nature itself is revolting against us."

Sister Beatrice scoffed, her eyes hardening as she cast a look of disapproval  at them all. "Silence, the lot of you! We must prepare for confession."

But the fear remained, like a growl in the belly of the beast that was the snowstorm.

After confession, the sisters returned to their quarters, shivering and huddling together for warmth. They tried to ignore the cold that seemed to seep through the walls, chilling them to the bone, intensifying the sense of unease and discomfort. As they slept fitfully, tossing and turning in their beds, Sister Elsbeth found herself drawn back to the forbidden feast once more. She couldn't shake the image of the cold, dead eyes of the man who had found them there. Something wasn't right about that night, and she knew it.

Determined to uncover the truth, she gathered her courage and met with Sister Agnes in secret. Together, they pored over the diary they had discovered â€“ pages filled with cryptic messages and strange symbols. It was clear that someone within the convent knew more than they were letting on. Sister Agnes's eyes flashed with determination as she turned the pages, her fiery hair tousled around her face in a halo of defiance. "We need to find out who wrote this," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "And why."

As they delved deeper into the diary's mysteries, they heard footsteps approaching down the corridor. Their hearts raced in unison as they quickly hid the book beneath Sister Margaret Walsh's modest bed. The footsteps stopped at their door, and they held their breath, hoping against hope that whoever it was would move on. But the door slowly creaked open, revealing the stern features of Sister Beatrice. Her  eyes narrowed as she took in their huddled figures, her gaze lingering on the diary tucked beneath the blankets. "What are you two doing up so late?" She demanded.

Sister Elsbeth swallowed hard, her throat dry. "Just discussing...our vows," she said finally. "We were trying to understand them better."

Sister Beatrice looked unsatisfied with this answer but didn't press further, her expression hardening as she turned to leave. The door clicked shut behind her, leaving the two girls trembling in the darkness.

Despite the chill that seemed to seep through the walls, proving ever-present, they continued their investigation later that night, huddling close to each other for warmth. The sound of their breathing became a rhythmic echo in the darkness as they pieced together the clues scattered throughout the pages. A strange language, a series of symbols - it seemed to be a map of some sort. A map to what, neither of them could say. But the closer they got to the truth, the more they knew someone wanted to keep them from finding it.

Days passed without any further revelations, but the cold grew worse. It seemed to seep through the walls, freezing their souls as well as their bodies. The nuns huddled close together, rubbing their hands to try and stave off the chill.

And then one morning, in the library, Sister Elsbeth noticed something peculiar. Sister Margaret Walsh, usually so shy and reticent, seemed different somehow. Her eyes were bright , her steps light. 

"What is it?" asked Sister Beatrice, watching her carefully.

"I think we've found it," whispered Sister Margaret Walsh, holding up a tattered, aged book. "The secret to stopping it."

They gathered round, eager to know more. Sister Margaret Walsh's voice grew stronger as she read from the book, translating the ancient symbols and sharing what she had discovered about the rite that had taken place so long ago. The feast, it seemed, was not just a celebration of faith but an offering to something ancient and dark. Something that thrived on fear and sacrifice.

As they listened to her words, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. Footsteps echoed through the halls, whispers carried on the wind that howled outside. The storm grew fiercer, snow piling up against the walls like a living thing.

Finally, they knew what they had to do. Sister Elsbeth and Sister Agnes once again braved the elements, trudging through the snow that now blanketed the ground. Their breaths plumed out before them in white clouds as they ventured deeper into the heart of the forest, guided only by the clues they'd found. The wind picked up, the trees groaning under its weight, their branches scraping against each other like bones against stone.

At last, they saw it - an ancient stone circle hidden amongst the trunks. A sickly green light flickered from within, casting eerie shadows. With trembling hands, they stepped forward, Sister Elsbeth tracing the symbols etched into the ground. It was the same as those in the diary. This was where it all began.

As they stood there, a shiver ran down their spines. They could feel eyes upon them, heavy breaths at their necks. They whipped around, but found nothing. The forest seemed to close in on them, suffocating.

Then, they saw it. A slight movement from the corner of their eyes - a figure draped in black huddled by the entrance to the circle. It was Sister Ingred, her dark hair whipping about in the wind. She held out a hand, beckoning them inside.

Taking a deep breath, they approached. Inside, it was even colder than before. The air smelled of blood and decay, and the stone walls seemed to pulse with an unholy energy. A small table sat in the center, laden with offerings - rotten fruits, withered flowers, and a single black candle flickering in the darkness. On the ground lay a diary, its pages opened to a particular entry.

They read with bated breath.

"...the ritual must be completed tonight. The stars align, and we will summon something great. It is time to appease the beast."

Sister Elsbeth felt her stomach twist. She knew now what they were dealing with. This wasn't just some harmless feast. This was a summoning, an offering to something ancient and dark. Something that thrived on fear and sacrifice. She turned to Sister Agnes, who nodded grimly. They had to stop this.

They rushed back to the convent, hearts pounding in their chests. They found their sisters huddled together in the kitchen, discussing the day's events. Sister Elsbeth spoke  in hushed tones, "We need to destroy the offerings. Now."

Sister Agnes nodded. Together, they grabbed matches and headed back to the clearing. But it was too late. As they reached the edge of the forest, they heard the roar of the beast, unleashed upon the world.

(If you want, you can add the epilogue where we find out the consequences of their actions, but it should be short and sinister.)

The storm raged on, battering the convent walls as if trying to break them down. Inside, the sisters huddled close, their hearts filled with fear and regret. They had failed.

Sister Elsbeth couldn't shake the feeling that they had unleashed something terrible upon the world. And now, they would have to pay the price. 

 

[Without writing the epilogue, the scene ends here.]

Sister Elsbeth led the way, her sharp cheekbones etched with determination. She glanced back at Sister Asterid, who looked pale, but determined. Sister Agnes followed closely behind, her fiery hair whipping in the icy wind. The path was treacherous, the ground slick with ice and snow. But they had to try.

Finally, they reached the clearing. It was empty - save for the piles of rotting food and broken cups. "We are too late," Sister Agnes whispered.

But Sister Elsbeth knew better than to give up. She knelt beside one of the piles, reaching for a piece of meat. It was cold to the touch, clammy with decay. She lit a match and watched as it flickered to life, illuminating the horror before them. The offering was tainted, twisted, as if it had a life of its own. They worked quickly, tossing the offerings into the flames, watching as they hissed and spat.

As they returned to the convent, their steps heavy with dread, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The cold air seemed to seep into their bones, chilling them to the core. Sister Agnes grimaced, "We can't let this happen again."

Sister Elsbeth nodded. Something dark lingered in the air, a presence that made the hairs on the back of their necks stand on end. They knew they had disturbed something ancient and terrifying.

Back in the convent, the sisters huddled together, whispering in hushed tones. They could feel it now - the malevolence of the storm, the whispers of the wind through the halls. The cold seemed to have taken on a life of its own, as if the very walls were breathing in the darkness. Sister Thora could feel it too, her eyes wide with fear as she clutched her rosary tightly.

Sister Ingred, the mysterious one, went missing that night. No one saw her leave, but her empty cot bore the telltale signs of her absence. Sister Elsbeth couldn't shake the feeling that she knew more than she was letting on.

In the morning, the storm had passed, leaving behind a world encased in ice. But the terror within the convent lingered. Sister Asterid found Sister Elizabeth huddled in the library, her breath fogging the glass of the window. "What are we going to do?" she whimpered.

Sister Elizabeth didn't answer, her eyes transfixed on the frozen world beyond. She had felt it too - the shift in the wind, the chill that seemed to come from within. They all had. And they knew that something sinister was afoot.  Something ancient and terrible.

Candles flickered in the chapel as Sister Agnes led a prayer meeting, her fiery hair a beacon of defiance against the encroaching darkness. Sister Elsbeth watched from a distance, her heart racing. She knew that they couldn't go on like this - something had to change. But what? She felt the weight of tradition press down on her, like a thousand stones pushing against her chest.

As they gathered for dinner, the power went out. The convent was plunged into complete darkness, save for the pale glow of the moonlight through the ice-covered windows. Their food, cold and congealed, lay untouched on their plates. The ice storm had cut off all contact with the outside world. They were truly on their own.

Sister Elsbeth saw her chance. She grabbed Sister Agnes' hand, pulling her into the darkness. "Come," she whispered. "I know where we can go." She led her through the maze-like corridors, their footsteps echoing in the silence. They descended a hidden staircase, their breath fogging in the frigid air. "This way," she murmured, her voice trembling.

The door creaked open, revealing a chamber unlike any other. The walls were adorned with crucifixes and icons, but something about them felt...off. As if they were watching. Sister Agnes shivered, sensing it too. "What is this place?" she whispered.

"It's the heart of the beast," Sister Elsbeth  replied, her voice hushed. "The forbidden feast took place here." She felt a sudden rush of adrenaline, her heart pounding in her chest. She pulled out a candle, striking it against the wall. Its flame flickered to life, casting dancing shadows around the room.

As they explored, their footsteps echoing in the silence, they found evidence of the feast: discarded shells, empty bottles, the lingering scent of forbidden pleasures. Sister Elsbeth's stomach churned at the thought. But it was the secret journal she found that sent a shiver down her spine. "It belongs to Mother Seraphina," she breathed. "She must have kept it hidden from us all this time."

They returned to their chamber, huddled together in the darkness, their hearts pounding with anticipation. Sister Elsbeth opened the journal, her hands shaking. Inside, she found pages filled with tales of debauchery and desire, of secret trysts and hidden desires. Sister Agnes' eyes widened in disbelief. "She's not who we thought she was," she whispered.

And so, they decided: they would confront her. The ice storm howled outside, bending trees and shattering windows. It seemed to mirror their own turmoil, their own desire for change. With trembling hands, Sister Elsbeth lit another candle, casting dancing shadows across the walls.

They found Mother Seraphina in her chambers, her face as pale  as the snow that pelted the convent's windows. "What do you want?" she hissed.

"We know your secret," Sister Elsbeth said, her voice steady despite the fear. "We know what you've been doing."

Mother Seraphina's eyes flashed with anger and defiance. "You came to me with accusations?" she spat. "After breaking into my private chambers?"

Sister Agnes stepped forward, her fiery spirit undaunted by the cold. "We seek only the truth," she said. "And we will expose it, no matter the cost."

The tension was palpable, thick enough to choke on. Sister Elsbeth flicked through the journal, the pages rustling like leaves in a windstorm. "Look," she said, pointing to a passage that detailed Mother Seraphina's involvement in the feast.

Mother Seraphina's face twisted in shame, but she didn't deny it. Instead, she scoffed, "It was merely a moment of weakness. A taste of the world outside these walls."

"A taste of temptation that led to sin," Sister Agnes countered.

The storm raged on, the wind howling like a pack of wolves. Ice cracked and shattered, leaving the convent cloaked in an eerie silence. As if even nature itself was waiting for their answer.

In the end, it was a act of boldness from Sister Elsbeth that sealed Mother Seraphina's fate. She pulled out the forbidden wine bottle from her habit, its weight heavy in her hands. "This is what you've been hiding?** she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Mother Seraphina's eyes darted around the room , the truth caught in her throat.

The Sisters stood in judgment, their breaths misting in the frigid air. A stern glare from Sister Walsh, a flicker of fear in Sister Ingred's eyes. Even Sister Asterid, usually so calm and composed, looked shaken.

Finally, Mother Superior Catherine entered, her presence a blizzard of white. She surveyed the scene with quiet authority, her gaze unyielding. "What have we here?" she asked, a hint of sadness in her voice.

No one spoke. The air was thick with anticipation, like a heavy fog rolling in from the sea.

With a sigh, Mother Catherine turned to Mother Seraphina. "You have fallen short of your vows," she said, her voice like the ringing of a church bell. "You must leave.**

The departure was swift and silent, like a shadow slipping away into the night. Sister Elsbeth watched her go, a strange mix of relief and sorrow in her heart. A chapter closed, but not without leaving its mark.

And so, with their leader gone, the remaining sisters gathered in the chapel, seeking solace and strength in their shared faith. The candles flickered, casting long shadows on the stained glass windows. The air was thick with incense, like a memory of lost innocence.
********
As they prayed, Sister Elsbeth felt a weight lift from her shoulders. Yet, she knew that the storm wasn't over yet. There were still secrets to be uncovered, desires to be sated. The darkness had only just begun to recede, revealing the true nature of their order.

Outside, the wind howled like a pack of wolves on the hunt, blowing snowdrifts against the convent walls. Inside, Sister Agnes sat upright, her fiery red hair glowing in the candlelight. She seemed to embody the unrest that now permeated the air.

Mother Seraphina's disappearance had left a void, like a missing piece in a puzzle. Some sisters wept silently, others murmured prayers under their breath, while Sister Elsbeth observed it all with a keen eye, her sharp cheekbones etched in concern.

Sister Elizabeth, usually tucked away in the library, ventured forward, her light brown hair shining in the soft glow. She whispered something about finding information on an ancient text, her voice breaking the heavy quiet. But Sister Elsbeth knew there was more to it than that.

As the night wore on, Sister Helena approached, her dark locks tousled from the wind. She glanced around warily, as if she carried secrets of her own. Sister Elsbeth met her gaze with curiosity, wondering what demons haunted her past.

Sister Asterid stayed close by her side, her brown eyes searching for answers amidst the chaos. She offered a reassuring squeeze of her hand, sharing in her unease.

Finally, as dawn broke like a new beginning, they emerged from the chapel, faces lined with weariness and fear. Sister Walsh, always the scholar, studied the frozen landscape with a wary eye, as if  it held answers to their questions. A heavy silence hung over them as they walked back to their quarters. No one spoke of Mother Superior Catherine's disappearance, but its absence was deafening.

The storm had passed, leaving behind a crisp bite to the air that stung their cheeks and lingered on their tongues like ice crystals. It seemed to mirror the tension within the convent walls.

Sister Agnes led the way, her fiery spirit burning bright, refusing to be quelled by the cold or the situation. She pushed open the heavy door to their dormitory with determination, as if daring the unknown to come forth.

The wind still howled outside, but inside it was deathly quiet. They all knew change was coming â€“ like a raging river carving its way through stone â€“ and they stood together, waiting for it to crash over them.

In the end, they found solace in each other's company, huddled together like embers amidst the chill. The silence was broken only by the sound of their collective breathing, punctuated by the occasional crackle of wood in the fireplace.

As sisters huddled under blankets or paced restlessly, Sister Elsbeth couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. A premonition perhaps? Or maybe it was the taste of uncertainty on her tongue, like ash after prayers. Either way, she couldn't ignore it.

She slipped away from their small circle, following an inkling that felt like a finger down her spine. It led her  to a hidden passageway, its entrance concealed by a tapestry depicting Mary Magdalene washing Jesus's feet.

Elsbeth hesitated before stepping inside, her heart racing in her chest like a rabbit caught in headlights.

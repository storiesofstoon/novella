# Mystery
  She started to create a sanctuary for herself in her small room, filling it with items that made her feel closer to home. She placed little stones and flowers around the room, and lit incense daily so that the sweet scent could melt away any feeling of frigid loneliness. She had left her family a week ago, walking through the night and into the morning with a small pack on her shoulder. In her bag were only some clothes, blankets, food for several days journey and a few dollars in change. As she crossed the countryside she saw many signs of war: abandoned homes where battles had been fought; fields barren from destruction or overgrown with weeds; farm animals left to fend for themselves in barns and sheds, but all these things faded away as Elsbeth came closer to where she needed to be; soon enough it was just herself against whatever might lay ahead.
  "Is everything up to your standards of comfort?" Sister Elsbeth was snapped out of her daydream by the question from a silhouette in the doorway. Mother Seraphina leaned into the light and said, "We need you to help us. We need you to clean out the dorm room of a dear sister that left our convent." She could see apprehension flash across Elsbeth's face but she pressed onward. "It needs to be done quickly, if this thing is going to go according to plan. It may not be pleasant work but it will certain help move things along faster."
  Elsbeth nodded slowly then stood up from her chair and stretched her arms above her head with determination before saying, "Alright then... let's get started".

  The two of them made their way to the dormitory where a single bed, desk and wardrobe were waiting. Everything was covered in dust and cobwebs. Elsbeth started by clearing away the cobwebs and then moved on to wiping down all surfaces with a damp cloth. She opened up windows as well, allowing fresh air to fill the room. Mother Seraphine made her way through the stillness of the hallways, illuminated only by the soft candles that seemed to find their way on behalf of some unseen flame.
  Now alone, Sister Elsbeth reached for the desk, cleaning it slowly and methodically with a wrinkled cloth. Reaching inside one side drawer she found a collection of hand-written letters, musty smelling, each one tucked away securely in envelopes decorated with tiny drawings and signatures from days gone by. She flipped through the crumbling pages with her thumb, skimming past prayers and blessings until she hesitated on a letter signed by Sister Georgette. It was addressed to Bishop Vincent and detailed her mission to investigate reports of outsiders attending a "forbidden feast" in the private walls of the convent. Curiosity piqued, she read further into Georgette's account; the bishop had charged her with determining whether outsiders had participated, based on rumors circulating through the congregation.
  Elsbeth's heart raced as she read further and it seemed clear that Bishop Vincent had suspected that Elsbeth was the one responsible for inviting the outsiders, though Sister Georgette's report to Bishop Vincent did not mention names. Elsbeth was about to close the letter when a folded note, tucked away amidst its pages, caught her attention. Written in a delicate script, it read:

"To Bishop Vincent,
I have been asked to investigate the supposed gathering of outsiders and I must admit that my curiosity is piqued. My work means something more than a routine inquiry - it may be an opportunity for redemption. I am coming soon to speak with you regarding this matter and pray that you will accept my offer.
Sincerely,
Sister Georgette Thomson"

Elsbeth knew that Sister Georgette had stumbled upon something of such gravity that it could not be contained in a single letter. She had to go in person, but before she could get the chance to spill the beans, she disappeared without a trace. Fear and worry kept rising within Elsbeth like floodwaters breaching their banks; her mind raced as she frantically tried to piece together what this all meant and how much Sister Georgette may have known about whatever mystery lay tangled beneath this strange affair. She straightened up the desk, her gaze lingering on the stack of letters she had sorted and piled. With a slight shake of her head, she set them aside for another time. Wrapping herself in a shawl against the cold winds whipping outside, she made her way to chapel. As night settled around campus and inky shadows started their dance along pathways lit by fading lanterns, that chill air moved through cloisters with an unrelenting persistence; one so keen it was as though all warmth had been stolen away from earth itself until only frigidity remained with no hint of return or relief ever again.
She kneels in the silent room, her head bent deep in prayer. Her hands are folded, and her eyes drift closed as she implores God for guidance. In the past hour she’d heard talk of a forbidden feast – what could it be? She muses upon this question as if pushing aside heavy curtains and unveiling hidden secrets beyond understanding. The revelation struck like lightning – perhaps it is something to do with celebrating on the Day of Atonement despite abstaining from doing so usually?
She continues to ruminate on the possibilities, feeling a coldness in her heart she had not noticed before. Although she is unsure what tomorrow will bring, She pondered the implications of her findings for a moment before deciding to keep them to herself. Taking a deep breath, she walked over to the dressing table and began preparing for the silent dinner. She found her old wrap dress still hanging in its place in her closet, put it on with loving care and ran a brush through her hair.
When she was ready, she took one last look at herself in the mirror before turning off all of lights except one small lamp by which to read until bedtime. With that done, she made sure all doors were tightly shut and opened up what would be an evening full of reflection and contemplation.
Seated with the others in the silent dining room, her thoughts raced as she tried to come to terms with what she had discovered. She replayed the events of the day over and over desperately seeking an answer that seemed too much of a paradox for even herself to understand.
Just then, the stillness of the room was broken when one of her companions spoke up.
"I think I understand what you're going through," someone said calmly. "Sometimes in life, we come across things that challenge us and confuse us but if we open our minds to possibilities beyond our own understanding, we can find unexpected beauty amidst this chaos."
“SILENCE!” Mother Seraphina shouted as a few sisters left to the kitchen. They returned to the table, each with a plate filled with freshly butchered meat. The rich smell of cooked protein wafted through the air as they all looked from one plate to another in anticipation. The first cut was made and everyone’s eyes alighted on their own portion of juicy tenderloin steak. All sat contentedly inhaling its aroma and savoring its flavor for several minutes before returning to contemplation. With renewed enthusiasm, they continued enjoying mouthful after hearty delightful mouthful until no piece remained untouched by their eager hands.
Mother Seraphina broke the silence that had descended upon them by offering a toast for giving thanks to the heavenly abundance they were so blessed with. As her companions raised their glasses in appreciation, she looked around and saw the contentment on everyone’s faces as they digested this nourishing meal. She smiled in satisfaction knowing that she had done her part in providing them with sustenance for this day.
The dinner quickly came to a close and the sisters bade each other farewell as they plodded through the frigid winds towards their dorms, fortified by Mother Seraphina’s kindness and generosity. As they walked away into the fading light of dusk, Mother Seraphine thought back on Elsbeth cleaning the missing nuns room. She had been so diligent in her duties even though no one had asked her to. She remembered feeling a gentle tug at her heartstrings when Elsbeth’s gaze met hers as she passed by, and how happy she felt seeing the happiness in Elsbeth’s eyes.
Mother Seraphina smiled quietly to herself as the soft rays of sunlight crept over the horizon to reveal a new day. Elsbeth might be none, but her light shined brighter than anyone’s in that moment, and Mother Seraphina was thankful for it. She thanked God for all of His blessings, especially those found in the least expected places and for not starving in the barren cold prairies.

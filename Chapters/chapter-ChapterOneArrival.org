# Arrival
  The convent stood out against the harsh, unforgiving landscape like a beacon of warmth and light in a sea of unending snow. The surrounding prairies were silent; blanketed by millions of sparkling crystals glinting off the winter sunlight. Barren trees stretched their skeletal arms up towards an icy sky, while distant mountains loomed like slumbering giants behind them. In this frozen wilderness, the convent remained untouched and isolated, a place that seemed to exist outside time itself where forgotten secrets lay buried beneath endless drifts of snow.
  The convent had become a refuge for many lost souls, who sought shelter from the world's harshness and turmoil. It was a place of solace where weary travellers could find safe harbour in its walls. After long days of journeying through the snow-covered plains, they would find comfort in its familiar embrace as they warmed themselves inside by fireplaces or in the chapel's hallowed embrace.
  As night fell, the light of the convent shone brightly against the darkness. It seemed as if something sacred was hidden within these walls... something that could be revealed only to those who had made a pilgrimage here and crossed its threshold.
  Most of those who stopped by were seeking refuge from a harsh winter; some found respite in both body and soul while others left more bewildered than when they had arrived. But one thing was certain, for those who found their way to the convent were never the same afterwards.

  The next morning, as dawn broke, a lone figure appeared out of the darkness and made its way through the snow towards the entrance of the convent. The figure was bundled in tattered clothing and wore a hood low over its face so as not to be seen. It seemed that it had made the journey for a specific purpose and was determined to enter the convent no matter what.
  The figure approached the entrance, where a single nun stood guard, her hands clasped before her in silent contemplation. She stepped aside without speaking and gestured towards the door, allowing wordless entry. A group of nuns made their way solemnly up the path, the sound of their footsteps muffled by the soft morning light. Each wore a deep hooded habit and cloak, and carried a rosary around her neck. The first nun was an elderly woman with gnarled hands that had seen decades in prayer; she lifted her aged head to scan for danger before committing herself further down that path. Behind her followed three more women: one bearing a wizened face with sharp eyes used to seeing all things; another mumbling softly as if in conversation with some unseen visitor; the last a tiny woman with bright eyes and an inviting smile that seemed to promise safety.
  The figure bowed its head slightly as the group approached, taking their silent permission to enter as an invitation. With a quick glance back at the guard nun, who nodded in approval, she stepped inside. The light of the golden morning sun streamed in through the stained glass windows, and as she did so there was a great stillness that seemed to settle over the room.
  The whole group felt a sudden sense of peace wash over them as they all entered, their worries and anxieties melting away until nothing remained but an ethereal calm. Candlelight flickered in one corner, casting a gentle warmth throughout the room.
  The figure was a small woman with bright eyes. She introduced herself as Elsbeth, explaining that she had been sent by her Order to help them on their journey.
  "My friends," she said slowly, her voice warm and calming, "I have been sent here to help you on your journey." She paused for a moment as if considering her words carefully before continuing. "This is a sacred place where we can connect with the divine and ask for guidance in our lives. It is a place of healing, growth, and learning. Together we can unlock the secrets of this universe and become closer to the divine."
  The group sat transfixed as Elsbeth spoke, her words washing over them like a fresh spring. They felt themselves opening up to these new ideas and possibilities that she presented.
  She continued, "Let us begin our journey by focusing on ourselves. Each of us has something unique to offer the world, and we must embrace that part of ourselves if we are to reach our full potential." She asked them each to close their eyes and take a few moments for themselves before beginning a guided meditation.
  As Elsbeth began her soothing words, the group found themselves entering a world of peace and serenity. They felt their worries and cares melt away as they were filled with an inner sense of lightness and warmth. After several minutes, Elsbeth instructed them to slowly open their eyes, take a few deep breaths, and feel the connection between themselves and all that is around them.
  Elsbeth closed her eyes and began to recall the details of a long journey. She had followed the trail of an ox wagon that had rumbled across the grassy prairie along the cold path to the convent and she was tired. The sun was setting in a brilliantly blue sky when she came upon the twenty-foot high walls surrounding this imposing religious fortress, nestled against groves of pine trees like so many sentinels on guard.

  The convent seemed to float amongst the wild, a cold island of remote refuge in an unforgiving landscape. The walls held back its secrets and provided protection from the brutality beyond. The yellowish-gray sky spread over them like a blanket, void of all hope and light; seeming to promise only dark night with no end in sight. Even here nature withheld its comfort - there was no babbling brook or singing birds - just the relentless wind that moaned through cracks in doors and windows alike. It whistled as if yearning for release from this barren place where time stood still without purpose or respite for those cloistered within.

  The group sat in stunned silence and looked around the dreary chapel slowly coming to terms with the desolation of their comfortable cocoon. Elsbeth broke the hushed reverence by calling them to join her in prayer, and they readily obeyed. Kneeling on hard wooden benches, she began softly chanting an old hymn which seemed to reverberate through the chamber, warming their cold hearts ever so slightly. In those moments of reflection, each of them allowed the silent sorrow to settle over their souls like a thick blanket and they found themselves longing for home even more deeply than before.
  When Elsbeth finished her prayer she opened her eyes and gazed upon them all with great affection before speaking. She reminded them of the promise they had made to each other as each new member arrived - that no matter how hard this journey could become, they would never forget one another and never give up.
  "As we continue on our way, let us remember this moment and carry it with us," she said solemnly. She paused for a moment, allowing her words to sink in. The room was still deathly silent and every face was looking up with awe. Finally she concluded with a determined nod of her head: "We can show them that we are strong, when they try to tear us down."

  They all nodded silently in agreement and rose from their knees with a newfound courage.Outside, the cold weather had returned with a vengeance. The wind blew in gusts across the trees. The nuns stirred into activity, surveying the grounds and calmly securing their home from the coming storm. Windows were shuttered tight with wooden board, chickens herded to shelter in a nearby barn, and buckets filled with sand set at the corners of each building to catch any flooding. With all duty finalized they gathered in prayer for divine protection before rushing off one by one back to their dorms as snow began falling around them like a soft white blanket.

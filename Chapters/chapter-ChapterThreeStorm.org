# Storm
The next morning, Elsbeth awoke to the sun's bright glare and she silently thanked God for giving her strength for another day. With a renewed sense of energy, she vowed to her herself anew in order to survive the winter with courage and hope. She had faced much worse before, and she would be able to face whatever came her way in the nunnery.
Elsbeth was determined to endure the isolation from the world and the cold of winter with courage, resilience, compassion and empathy - traits that were honed while struggling against adversity in her past life. She was deeply aware of the beauty and importance of sisterhood, which Mother Seraphina had nurtured among her sisters. Although she sometimes clashed with Sister Thora over different points of view, Elsbeth respected her inquisitive nature and all that it could bring to the nunnery.
Mother Seraphine kept a watchful eye on Elsbeth as she adapted to the nunnery life. Despite her stern exterior, Elsbeth knew without a doubt that Seraphina had her best interests at heart and was protective of all her sisters. With guidance from both Mother Seraphina and God, Elsbeth believed she could make it through this winter safely and successfully. In spite of the difficulties she faced, she felt secure in knowing that she had the support of her new family and she was determined to make it through. With strength, courage, and compassion Elsbeth faced another day in the nunnery with grace and confidence.
The nuns clustered in the chapel, gathered for morning prayers. Their chanting voices echoed off the walls as they entreated their Lord. Then, from an alcove to their side emerged a procession of new faces -- more nuns in simple brown habits and white wimples. As they advanced slowly into view, light shimmered through windows behind them illuminating each figure with a cherubic halo of gold and silver rays; so reminded that although it was man-made majesty which brought these holy women within its walls-- it was divine grace that blessed them with life everlasting.
Sister Elsbeth stood at the center, among her peers. God had given her a chance to begin again and she was determined to set a passionate example of faith in this new life she had been given. Despite their struggles with the isolation from the world and cold winter, each nun could draw strength from one another's presence for it was not God but the divinity of their collective spirit that sustained them.
This was the foundation on which Sister Elsbeth built her compassion and empathy; each new sister welcomed with open arms and a prayer in her heart. Through their kindness and sacrifice, they could learn to lean on God in times of hardship and joy alike. A beacon of faith in this new home. Together, they were all part of the same divine family.
Mother Seraphine led the sisters in prayer, frowning while scanning those present, pausing on Sister Elsbeth for a moment. As the echoes died away, they stirred at once and rose from their seats. There was no sound as they filed out; an unspoken agreement had been made to enter into silence when breakfast was served. Everyone proceeded to the dining hall without a word being spoken, taking care not to disturb anyone else's peace or concentration by making any unnecessary noise with their feet or bodies. They quietly took up places around the tables set for them before silently partaking of breakfast together without interruption for some time afterwards.
It was only after the meal that Elsbeth took her first step towards true integration into the sisterhood. She nervously approached Mother Seraphina and bowed before her, placing her hands on the ground in a gesture of respect and submission. "I thank you for your kindness," she said quietly yet firmly, risking a glance up at the matriarch.
Mother Seraphine met her gaze and smiled slightly. "Sister Elsbeth, welcome to our home," she said kindly. "You will be welcomed here with open arms as one of us. We have much to learn from each other and I trust you shall find your place among us soon enough." She gestured for Elsbeth to stand before embracing her fondly.
The nuns glided silently past the chapel, their black robes billowing in the draft like shadowed curtains. They took no notice of one another; each was lost deep in her own thoughts, their faces composed and serious. As they neared the kitchen door at the end of a long hallway, some signaled to one another for tasks: One with an incline of her head; two with raised hands, a sign that she would take care of laundry duties that morning. Then they all slipped inside and started to prepare for their chores: scrubbing tables and floors, kneading dough for breads and baked goods, chopping vegetables for soups and stews.
At the center of the kitchen stood Mother Seraphine, watching them all with a critical eye. Elsbeth had only ever seen her like this--aloof and distant, yet still striving to fulfill her duty as head mother in enforcing order among the nuns. Her noble spirit served as an inspiration even when she was reprimanding her flock. Elsbeth felt an instant respect for her and knew that despite the struggles of the isolated nunnery life, Mother Seraphine was a person of true compassion and empathy. She turned to Elsbeth with an expression of weary warmth, as if she had been expecting her all along, and said kindly "Now let's get you settled in, Sister Elsbeth. You must be exhausted from your journey; the creeping cold will soon take hold on this mountain."
Mother Seraphine asked Sister Thora to take Sister Elsbeth for a tour of the monastery grounds. She took her by the arm and began walking towards the gardens, pointing out various statues and sculptures that were important to them. As they walked along the stone pathways, winding through tall maple trees that swayed heavily in the cold wind, Thora paused and pointed towards a meadow filled with dead plants and wilted flowers.
"This is one of my favorite places when I need to clear my head," she said. "It's so peaceful and serene despite the cold. I'm sure you will find solace here too, Sister Elsbeth."
Elsbeth smiled, feeling a kinship with her newfound friend. She could tell that Thora held deep admiration for Mother Seraphine, as did the rest of the sisters - and indeed for good reason. Despite her strict nature, Mother Seraphine had a profound kindness that was always evident in her words and actions. As they continued their tour of the grounds, Elsbeth couldn't help but admire Thora's spirited nature and courage to challenge traditions. She could see why she was so beloved by the other nuns - her optimism for change brought hope to everyone.
Sister Asterid was the first to notice the signs of a wind storm that had been rolling in for days. She felt it in her bones and saw it in the sky, gathering strength like an increasing swell on a bright-blue sea. With urgency she ran to warn those inside of what was coming, calling out instructions with each step down the hallway toward safety: "Close every window! Gather everything from outside you might need!"
In moments they were all racing back into their hurriedly prepared kitchen; ready and hopeful despite knowing that this may not be over soon. Elsbeth watched Thora rally the sisters around her, their fear subsiding as hope swept through the group. She was determined to make sure everyone was safe and warm despite being isolated from the outside world, and her compassionate and empathetic nature shone through in that moment. Mother Seraphine too seemed encouraged by Thora's presence; she gave a subtle nod of approval as Thora took charge of the situation. Even in the face of a fierce storm, Thora's spirited nature and courage to challenge traditions made her a beacon of hope for those seeking change within the convent. With determination, Mother Seraphine sealed the windows shut while inside they all prayed that safety and shelter would come in time.
The storm raged on for hours, but eventually its fury abated, leaving a calm of quietude in its aftermath. In that moment, the nuns all looked to Thora for guidance. Taking a deep breath and looking around the room, she said with assurance "We will survive this." Her warm reassuring smile brought a sense of relief to everyone present.
The following morning as they stepped outside from their shelter, Elsbeth noticed something change in Mother Seraphine; despite her stern exterior, Seraphina's maternal instincts were clear as she looked upon the sisters with a deep love and protection. Though they may clash in their views sometimes, it was through Thora's courage that brought out the best in Mother Seraphine.
From then on Elsbeth would never forget Sister Thora and all she had done for the convent; though she could never quite explain why, she found solace in the strength of Thora's spirit. Even in the face of tremendous odds, even when it seemed like hope was lost - with her courage and determination to make a change, Sister Thora found a way to bring light into the darkness. And amidst all this Elsbeth had realized that though we may struggle at times, even in the her darkest moments - we shall survive.
And so with newfound courage, Elsbeth set forth on her journey with a promise to herself; no matter how difficult life may become, she vowed never to give up hope. She was determined to use that same strength and determination as Sister Thora - learning from those around her and bring light into the darkness that had so long shadowed her.
The nuns wasted no time after the storm. One by one, they emerged from the convent and into the grey morning light smeared with rain clouds, each clutching a broom or mop made from wood that had been cut onsite in their workshop. They moved without speaking; only a few words exchanged here and there as they worked to clear away debris left behind: branches strewn about like kindling, small rocks scattered hither-thither over pathways slick with mud, all of which was quickly swept aside until once again everything seemed neat and orderly. In unison they returned inside their humble abode, having done what they could to assure the convent wasn't damaged beyond repair.
Sister Elsbeth nervously approached Mother Seraphine in the quiet hallway. She stood quietly, waiting for a moment to be acknowledged, though she could feel her heart pounding against her chest in anticipation of the question on her mind. Finally summoning up all of the courage within herself, she asked timidly "Mother Seraphine would you tell me about sister Georgette? I need to know what happened." Mother Seraphine sighed and nodded slowly before turning towards Elsbeth with a kind gaze; understanding and compassion evident in even just This small gesture.
"Sister Georgette was new here - full of life and curiosity, eager to learn more about our customs and rituals. She had a special interest in one of our annual Advent traditions  an ancient custom that is not spoken of openly for fear it might bring trouble upon us all," Mother Seraphine said with a shudder. Elsbeth's eyes widened at this, wondering what this 'forbidden feast' could be. Before she had the chance to ask any further questions, Mother Seraphine continued her explanation.
"Sister Georgette did not understand our way of life or the sacrifices we must make in order to survive here and keep our traditions alive. She ventured out beyond the walls of the nunnery in search of knowledge, despite our warnings to stay put. We soon began to receive reports that Sister Georgette had gone missing and we feared the worst."
Tears filled Elsbeth's eyes as she listened, overwhelmed with sadness at this tragic story. "We have searched far and wide for her but there has been no sign," Mother Seraphine sighed. "We must have faith that she will be found safe, but until then we must all struggle with the isolation from the world and its cold grip."
Elsbeth couldn't help but feel a deep empathy for Sister Georgette and those who sought her return. Despite her own struggles with the nunnery's customs, she could not help but admire Mother Seraphine's compassion and dedication to her sisters. She could only hope that Sister Georgette would return, safe and sound, to the arms of her family. Until then, Elsbeth vowed to push forward with courage and faith in the face of uncertainty.
With a heavy heart, Elsbeth returned to her quarters alone unable to shake off the sadness of Sister Georgette's disappearance. She could only hope and pray for her safe return, and found solace in her rosary beads as she closed her eyes to sleep.

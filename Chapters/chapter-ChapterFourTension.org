# Tension
The next morning, Elsbeth joined her sisters in prayer as usual. Though she still wondered about the mystery of Sister Georgette's disappearance, she reminded herself to keep faith and remain hopeful for a miracle.
As they finished their prayers, a sudden gust of wind blew through the chapel; and when it cleared, Elsbeth could have sworn she saw Mother Seraphine's face soften with relief.
A moment later, Mother Seraphine's aged face seemed to hold a secret, as if she had something hidden in her mind that she was unwilling or unable to share. She sat in silence, but an unspoken mystery lingered around her like smoke from a recently extinguished candle. Her lips moved almost imperceptibly and the lines of worry on her forehead deepened as if suppressed thoughts threatened to spill over of their own accord and reveal what lay beneath that half-smile of hers.
But Elsbeth could only guess, and for now her questions remained unanswered. She bit her lip would she ever find out what happened to Sister Georgette? Why was Mother Seraphine so secretive about it all?
It seemed as if in that moment an invisible hand had shuttered the window to a secret world far beyond Elsbeth's understanding, one that could not be opened without a key. Maybe she had to take matters into her own hands and find out the truth about Sister Georgette and the 'forbidden feast' for herself. And if she stumbled upon any other dark secrets, so be it; for only then would Elsbeth finally understand who Mother Seraphine truly was beneath her stern exterior and just what was hidden in the shadows of that 'forbidden feast.'
But first, she thought, I must continue looking for clues. With a heavy heart and a determined gait Elsbeth exited the nunary's chapel in search of Sister Georgette...and perhaps answers to her questions as well. She knew one thing was for sure; if there were secrets to be found, Mother Seraphine would be the one to hold them. She was sure of it. With this resolute thought in mind, Elsbeth's courage rose and she finally understood why she was sent to the nunary, for her investigation had only just begun.
So with that thought in mind, Elsbeth set out on an adventure to unlock the truth behind Sister Georgette's mysterious disappearance and the forbidden feast. She was determined to do whatever it took to shine a light on the shadows lurking within her walls.
But little did Elsbeth know, Mother Seraphine was watching her every move from afar, ready to protect her beloved nuns from all of the secrets Elsbeth was about to uncover. With a steely determination, Elsbeth moved forward not knowing what would come next, but trusting that she had been sent for a purpose...and it was time to find out what it truly meant.
Mother Seraphine was a formidable presence, and it seemed to the others that her shadow grew more ominous with each passing day. Sisters Thora and Asterid tiptoed around her like skittish mice, darting away if she so much as looked their way. Tension began to build whenever they were in the same room together; an unspoken competition brewed between them for approval from Mother Seraphine, who watched all three of them like a hawk watches its prey. Even Sister Asterid's sweet singing voice could not lighten the atmosphere which had descended among their small cloistered family; rather than soothing tensions it was starting to do the opposite.
Sister Asterid and Sister Thora sat in a corner of the chapel, the sun's morning rays streaming through stained glass windows. As their fellow sisters sang hymns, each sister began to hum along with their own tune. Suddenly this peaceful atmosphere was broken by an argument as one sister accused the other of singing too loudly off-key. Tempers flared and voices rose as Thora looked at Asterid with an accusing glare and said, "What did you think you were doing? Couldn't tell the key of the song?"
Asterid threw her hands up in frustration. "I was singing! This isn't a library; it's a worship service!"
Thora retorted, "It doesn't matter people are here to pray and listen to God's word. Not your caterwauling."
Asterid scowled and crossed her arms over her chest. "This is why we can never have nice things around here; because some people just don't understand that music and worship can be separate. God is a source of joy, and singing brings us one step closer to Him."
Thora looked away, her anger dissipating as Asterid's words sunk in. She had forgotten that for some people, their faith was intertwined with their passion for the arts. Thora sighed and said, "I'm sorry. I just want everyone to do the right thing and keep this place sacred."
Asterid nodded, understanding in her eyes. "I know," she said softly. "But don't forget that even God appreciates a good song every once in awhile."
The two sisters shared a smile before joining back into the chorus of voices, singing praises of joy to their Lord.
Through it all, Thora knew that her daring had come from a source much bigger than herself - the spirit of God. This thought encouraged her to challenge convention, inspiring those around her to seek out change and accept the beauty of individuality within the walls of this convent. Thora's spirited nature and courage to challenge traditions make her a beacon of hope for those seeking change within the convent, ultimately leading them closer to God and a greater understanding of themselves.
As the song came to an end, Elsbeth felt the tension growing in the room. She sat a little stiffly, her hands on either side of her notebook, noting each exchange as if it were an entry in a ledger: Mother Seraphine's reprimand here; Sister Thora's rude response there; the tension between Sister Thora and Sister Asterid. Suddenly aware that she was being watched, Elsbeth looked up to find Mother Seraphine's eyes upon her from across the room, hard and questioning. A chill ran through Elsbeth's body as she quickly looked away, a surge of emotions rising inside her. She had never felt so out of place in her life, but she couldn't deny the comfort that came from being surrounded by such strong and compassionate women who were willing to stand up for what they believed in and follow their own hearts.
As the day drew on, Mother Seraphine stepped lightly through the doors of the refectory and passed by, oblivious to her sisters who had gathered for lunch. She kept her gaze fixed on the horizon as though propelled forward by a mysterious force. Her steps were light but purposeful, directed towards an unknown destination that lay beyond sight and out of reach. With each step she felt a strange stirring in her heart which drove her onward; until at last, when all trace of doubt had dissipated from within, she opened one final door, revealing something she didn't want anyone finding out about but something that was needed so the nuns could survive the harsh winter to come.

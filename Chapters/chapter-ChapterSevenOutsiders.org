# Outsiders
The snowstorm howled like a possessed beast, tearing at the earth with its furious gusts and drowning out all sounds but its own fury. The wind whipped through the skeletal trees, bending them to its will, while the thick flakes blanketed everything in sight, obliterating any trace of the world beyond the veil of white. It was a nightmare of nature's wrath, a storm that could snuff out the light of civilization in an instant and leave only darkness and despair in its wake. In such conditions, it was easy to lose one's way, to become lost and suffer a fate worse than death. Yet for the two outsiders, this was no ordinary reckoning with the elements. They trudged on, their boots sinking into the snow with every step, their faces set in determined expressions, driven by a mission that eclipsed any discomfort or fear.
The man, with rugged features that spoke of a life hardened by hardship, marched ahead of the woman, his broad shoulders hunched against the onslaught of the elements. He wore thick layers of clothing that barely muffled the sound of his heavy breathing, his eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of their quarry. The woman followed close behind, her long coat billowing out behind her like wings of darkness, every step an act of defiance against the unyielding cold. They had been walking for hours now, ever since they had received word that her friends had ventured into these treacherous lands in search of solace and never returned. She clutched her staff tightly, her knuckles white with desperation, hoping that it would guide them to safety.
As they approached the looming figure of the convent, its spires jutting out from the snowy vista like fossils rising from an ancient sea, they both felt a shiver run down their spines. The nuns who dwelled within were rumored to be harsh taskmasters, unyielding in their devotion to their faith and utterly inscrutable to outsiders. But tonight, they needed help, and they were willing to pay the price for it.
The bells tolled ominously in the distance, each strike echoing through the valley like a hammer on an anvil, warning all who dared to venture near of the dangers that lurked within these hallowed halls. But still, the duo pressed on, their footsteps growing louder with every step, a rhythmic beat against the suffocating silence. The heavy iron door groaned as they pushed it open, revealing a dimly lit foyer with walls adorned in flickering candlelight. Their eyes adjusted slowly to the gloom, taking in the shadows dancing along the stone walls and the eerie hush that filled the air.
"We're here for the missing ones," the man growled out, his voice a low rumble that seemed out of place in this hallowed silence. "We need your aid in finding them."
The woman spoke up as well, her voice trembling slightly, her breath hitching in the frigid air. "We've been sent by the Count himself - we cannot return empty-handed."
Mother Seraphine watched them from her seat by the fireplace, steepling her fingers together, her face impassive. She could feel the convent's eyes upon her, like a thousand piercing needles digging into her back. She knew they whispered about her decision to let outsiders inside these walls; some even calling for her head for it. But she believed in justice above all else - even if it meant breaking tradition. The wind howled outside, battering the convent like a ravenous beast trying to break free. Snowflakes swirled and danced, painting the world white, obliterating everything in their path. It was a nightmare of nature, a maelstrom of ice and fury.
"Welcome," she uttered, her voice calm yet commanding. She rose from her seat, her robes flowing around her like the cloak of authority she wore so well. Her eyes darted between the two outsiders, taking in their appearance. The man was tall and broad-shouldered, his face hidden beneath a hood that cast an ominous shadow over his features. The woman by his side was slender yet resilient, her eyes burning with determination. They were an odd pair, she mused, but they had business here. 
"My name is Mother Seraphine," she introduced herself, extending a hand. It trembled slightly, but no one would ever guess it. " I trust you found your way here despite the storm?"
The man bowed his head, revealing a rugged yet handsome face with a jagged scar running down his cheek. The woman remained stoic, her gaze never leaving the older woman's face. "We did, Mother Superior. My name is Jacob, and this," he gestured to the woman beside him, "is Amelia."
Their voices were rough, like gravel against stone, yet there was no hint of malice in their words. They were here on a mission, she could feel it in their very bones. And yet... something about them unsettled her.
Amelia spoke first, her voice cold as ice. "We need your help."
Mother Seraphine nodded, hiding her surprise well. "And what sort of help might that be?"
Jacob took a step forward, his eyes scanning the pristine halls. "We're looking for someone. A man named Thomas."
The words hung in the air like a shroud, heavy and foreboding. She hesitated, weighing her options. To involve herself in the affairs of outsiders could mean disaster - but to turn away those in need would go against everything she stood for. "May I ask why you seek Thomas?"
Amelia's grip tightened on her staff, her knuckles white. "He's missing."
Mother Seraphine's brow furrowed, her gut twisting. "Missing? For how long?"
Jacob let out a sigh. "He's been gone a fortnight."
She nodded slowly, maintaining her composure. "I see. Well, we do not have anyone by that name here. Perhaps you may have been misinformed."
The lie sat heavily on her tongue, but it had to be done. She couldn't risk revealing their secrets, not yet.
Jacob shook his head, a frown marring his features. "But we were told - "
"Perhaps your information is incorrect," she interrupted gently, her voice like honeyed steel. "Rest assured, if he had been here, we would have aided you in your quest."
The three exchanged glances, uncertainty etched on their faces. "Very well," Jacob said after a moment. "But we will return."
Mother Seraphine nodded once. "Of course. Now, please, come in and join us for tea. We have much to discuss."
Inside, the air was heavy with anticipation. The convent was a place of silent prayer and contemplation, but right now, it felt as if the walls were closing in. She led them through the winding halls, their footsteps echoing off the cold stone walls. The scent of burning incense filled her nostrils, mingling with the musty aroma of old books and candle wax. Sister Maria hurried to prepare the tea, her hands shaking ever so slightly as she poured the steaming liquid into delicate china cups.
They took their seats, the outsiders looking around warily. Mother Seraphine smiled, her heart racing as she waited for the right moment to strike. The room was decorated in shades of burgundy and gold, the stained glass windows casting dancing shadows across the walls. The wooden table creaked under their weight as they settled in.
She leaned forward, speaking in a low voice, her eyes never leaving their faces. "I must warn you," she began, "our convent has its fair share of... peculiarities. Some may find it unsettling." Her gaze flickered towards the door leading to the crypts beneath them. "But rest assured, we mean no harm."
The outsiders exchanged uneasy glances, not quite believing her words.
She continued, her voice dropping even lower. "There are secrets that must be kept hidden - for the greater good." They nodded, not quite understanding, but too afraid to ask questions. She watched them carefully, relieved that they didn't push the issue.
The tea, when it arrived, was bitter and strong, each sip burning their tongues. They sipped quietly, eyes darting around the room, taking in every detail. Each nun watched them with unblinking eyes, their curiosity piqued and their minds whirring with questions.
Mother Seraphine watched them as they drank, her own thoughts turning inward. She knew what awaited them, but she couldn't let them discover the truth too soon. Not until she had no other choice.
"You two must be hungry after travelling in this weather," Mother Seraphine said while making a hand gesture to some nuns by the door.
"We should be on our way," responded Amelia.
"I could eat," Jacob stared at Amelia with a frown.
"I guess I could as well," Amelia stared down at the floor.
Outside, the storm raged on. Thunder boomed in the distance as lightning lit up the sky like a canvas of fireworks. The wind howled like a pack of wolves, shaking the ancient walls of the convent. It was a force to be reckoned with, yet inside, all was calm.
The nuns led the outsiders to the refectory, a large room where they took their meals together. The long wooden table was set with simple yet nourishing fare - hot soup, fresh bread, and a steaming cup of tea. It was simple but comforting, just what they needed to warm their bodies and spirits after their treacherous journey.
They sat side by side, the sisters observing them from across the room. Their eyes flickered with curiosity and suspicion, wondering who these outsiders were and what they wanted. Mother Seraphine watched from the head of the table, her face impassive. She knew something was amiss but couldn't put her finger on it.
As they ate, the flavors mingled on their tongues. The soup was rich and hearty, filled with earthy vegetables and herbs. The bread had been freshly baked, its crust crisp and golden brown. The tea was strong and soothing, warming their insides like a hug from a loved one. Despite their situation, they felt a strange sense of peace wash over them.
But as they reached for their third helping of soup, Sister Thora gasped. There was only one chicken left - the last frozen chicken. A wave of tension washed over the room. The sisters exchanged worried glances, their movements slowing as they realized the significance of what this meant.
Mother Superior Seraphine glared at Sister Agnes, who merely shrugged nonchalantly. She had insisted on feeding the outsiders, but she hadn't anticipated this consequence. Desperate to keep up appearances, she offered to go find more, but no one moved. They couldn't risk it; the outside world was too dangerous, too unpredictable.
Amelia took a sip of her tea, feeling the warmth spread through her veins like a gentle caress.  Jacob stared out the window, his jaw clenched. The storm was still raging outside, snow pelting against the panes and turning the world into a blinding whiteout. It seemed as if nature itself was conspiring against them.
Sister Elsbeth watched them both, her heart heavy with worry. She knew they needed help, but she didn't know how to give it without causing chaos within these sacred walls. Across from her, Sister Asterid fidgeted, her hands trembling slightly. She had always been timid but was finding courage she didn't know she possessed.
Meanwhile, Sister Agnes sat back, her face blank but her mind racing. She knew change was coming whether they wanted it or not. She could feel it in the air like a shift in the winds before a storm. And she was determined to be at the center of it all.
As Mother Superior Seraphine stood to leave, the door creaked open, admitting a gust of icy wind. Everyone held their breath as they waited for what was next.
In the kitchen, Sister Thora stood with Sister Ingred, their faces pale and strained. They exchanged worried glances before turning back to the task at hand. The last frozen chicken had been discovered, its icy flesh gleaming under the harsh light. As they worked together to prepare it for cooking, they couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a meal; it was a symbol of their fragile existence.
Back in the dining room, silence reigned as the nuns resumed their meal. Each bite of food tasted like ash in their mouths, each sip of tea like lead. Their eyes flickered between the outsiders and each other, curiosity and suspicion warring within them. The wind howled outside, mocking their fragile sanctuary.
Sister Elsbeth finished her meal first, her stomach churning with nausea and worry. She excused herself, her shoes echoing against the stone floor as she walked away. In the solitude of her room, she collapsed onto her bed, staring up at the ceiling and wondering how much longer they could last.
Outside, the storm showed no signs of abating. It seemed to have settled in for the night, like an unwelcome guest who wouldn't leave. The howling grew louder, more insistent, penetrating even the thick stone walls of the convent. Sister Elsbeth shivered, covering herself with a thin blanket that did little to ward off the cold.
Sister Agnes watched her leave, her fiery hair a beacon of defiance in the dim light. She turned her attention back to her meal, but her mind was elsewhere. Tomorrow would come, and with it, change. Whether it would be for better or worse, only time would tell.
Mother Seraphine sat at the head of the table, her eyes closed in prayer. She could feel the weight of her responsibility pressing down on her shoulders. How much longer could they survive? And at what cost? She opened her eyes, meeting the gaze of Sister Asterid across the room. A shared look passed between them, full of concern and uncertainty.
Sister Thora sat next to her, scowling at the outsiders. They didn't belong here, she thought. They were disrupting their way of life, their traditions. But even she couldn't deny the desperation in their eyes. She took a sip of her tea, its bitter taste reminding her of the harsh reality they all faced.
Meanwhile, Sister Ingred sat alone in her cell, her fingers tracing the rough stone wall. Memories of another life flooded her mind, a life she had left behind for this one. She shivered, the cold seeping into her bones. The storm raged on, as if nature itself was trying to warn her of something she couldn't quite grasp.
She glanced up at the imposing walls of the convent through the high circuler hole in the stone that acted as a window, feeling trapped and alone. The wind picked up, whipping her hair around her face, carrying with it the scent of death.
"We must prepare," she whispered to the empty room. "The end is near."
